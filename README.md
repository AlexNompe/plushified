## Yeah
This mod is still in development, butttt, who cares? Nobody. I should just go to sleep, I'm not the one to do this kind of stuff.

Btf, the project is open sourced soooooo if you want do add something, feel free to do it!

## About the mod 
Oh and yes, this mod is about plushies, like, about an incredibly large amount of them. ~~145~~ 179 at the moment.

Plushies are the new obtainable decoration block with a special sound effect upon clicking on them _(cute little squeak :3)_. If you want, you can collect a lot of them and create an entire room of little buddies, idk.

Ahhh, and yes, the plushies can be obtained via looting structures, fishing, archeology, recieving a gift from your cat, getting a trial chambers loot and a few more things I just forgor.
